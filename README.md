# Corum (Web App)

Corum is a place for people who want to share stories related to Covid-19. Whether you wish to share your experience of contracting Covid-19, experience taking vaccines, or just the impact of the pandemic on your life, Corum is an all-in-one platform where you can discuss in forums, write blog posts, see events, and hand out surveys from the web and the comfort of your smartphone.

The Corum web app is built using Django, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS as a part of the final group project for CSGE602022 (Platform-based Programming)
